## Chika's test:

There are well known, easily memorable tests for divisibility of a number by integers like 2,3,5, etc. Checking for divisibilty of a number by 7 has been by far the hardest one.

Chika's test is a test for divisibility of a number by 7, developed by Chika Ofili. He realised that if you take the last digit of any whole number, multiply it by 5 and then add this to the remaining part of the number, you will get a new number. And it turns out that if this new number is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7.

This is a small python script I wrote which proves that his method indeed works.
